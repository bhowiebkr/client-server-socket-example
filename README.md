# Client, Server socket example in python

I was dealing with some python socket communication bugs in Qt based GUI so I built this simple example of 2 apps (client and server) to test on. I have it setup to run on the same machine but the code can be easily modified to run on a local or external network.

If you see anything that could be done better let me know and do a pull request and Iâ€™ll check it out.
